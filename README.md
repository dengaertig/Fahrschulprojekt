# FProject

Here I am working on a driving school planner. 

The learner driver and the driving instructor can log in here.

The driving instructor login is hidden behind a paywall for a monthly subscription. The driving instructor then has access to, for example, 15 student logins.

The student can accept and reject offers, as well as offer counter-suggestions. The driving instructor as well.

The driving instructor has access to his fleet of cars and can show the student which car will be driven at the next appointment. There will be a statistics dashboard, which will present the learner driver with statistics about driving hours and theory hours as well as exams and other things.
